Code Question:

Amazon is hosting a team hackathon. 
1. Each team will have exactly teamSize developers. 
2. A developer's skill level is denoted by skill[i]. 
3. The difference between the maximum and minimum skill levels within a team cannot exceed a threshold, maxDiff. 
Determine the maximum number of teams that can be formed from the contestants. 

Example 
skill = [3, 4, 3, 1, 6, 5] 
team5ize = 3 
maxDiff = 2 

At most, 2 teams can be formed: [3, 3, 1] and [4, 6, 5]. 
The difference between the maximum and minimum skill levels is 2 in each case, 
which does not exceed the threshold value oft. 

Function Description 
Complete the function countMaximumTeams in the editor below.

countMaximumTeams has the following parameter(s): 
int skill[n]: the developers' skill levels 
int teamSize: the number of developers to make up a team 
int maxDiff: the threshold value 

Returns: int: the maximum number of teams that can be formed at one time
